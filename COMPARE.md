###Comparing React with Angular Js

The major difference I noticed right off the bat is that React is very heavily JS and barely touches the HTML file. Though, using directives in Angular does cut down on this it is still hard to get use to when manipulating the DOM heavily in JS.

For me, I kept running into issues when trying to create forms to update the data. Once I got the form up, I was unable to type in the data. Since there is limited documentation and training videos as compared to Angular's robust documentation/tutorials, this proved to be challenging.

Another major stand-out is how much React effects the CRUD calls. With Angular, we didn't mess with that, but focused more on populating the data that we already had on our server through the DOM rather than creating AJAX calls and re-wiring a bunch of the pre-existing code. Because of this mess, I created a simple one resource with inline data.

My overall experience with the switch was quite negative and frustrating to say the least. I understand that it might be powerful if i understood what was going on but hard when there is not much material out there to ramp up for this sort of project.
